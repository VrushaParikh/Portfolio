Hello! I'm Vrusha Parikh, from Vadodara, also known as Cultural Capital of Gujarat.

I love building things using Python.

I have completed my Bachelors from [SVIT Vasad](https://www.svitvasad.ac.in/) in Information Technology (2017-present) with [9.88 CGPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YycFLoiecaey0WCnFziAEfezjpC8QwgO/view?usp=sharing). 

I have also been finalist of Smart India Hackathon (Software) 2020 undertaking problem [DS159](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yf5RxbprVa2hE3mMn9CTLGAVX6InQF0W/view?usp=sharing).
